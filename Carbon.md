Introduction
------------

### Current state and drivers of deforestation/degradation in West Africa

### What do we know about the carbon recovery rates in secondary forests ?

### What are the possible drivers of these rates?

### Research Questions

What are the current levels of carbon stocks in young secondary forests relatively to undisturbed (logged or not) natural forests? At which rates the carbon stocks are reconstituting? What are the main drivers of these rates?

Materials & Methods
-------------------

    ## The reference dataset contains 16467 wood density values 
    ## Your taxonomic table contains 336 taxa

### Site Description

### Data Computation

### Statistical Analyses

#### Comparing secondary forests to logged and natural forests

In order to campare the forest structure

Discussion

You can also embed plots, for example:

``` r
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
